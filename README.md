# Udacity Movie Trailer Website Project

What this is about?
-------------------

This is a prototype project developed as part of the Udacity Full Stack course. My objective was to list my favorite movies on a webiste where I could click on a listing and view the movies trailer.


How do I use this?
------------------

Quick usage:

1. Clone the repository
2. Edit entertainment_center.py
	- Edit the movie lisitngs with movies of your own choice. Pro-tip: Use [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) for movie posters and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) for the movie trailer
	- Save entertainment_center.py and Run in IDE or on CLI via `python entertainment_center.py`
3. A browser should open and display your movie listings as a grid of movie posters.
4. Click on a movie poster to view the trailer.
5. Turn up the volume and Enjoy!
